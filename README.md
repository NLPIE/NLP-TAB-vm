Natural Language Processing Type and Annotation Browser (NLP-TAB)
===

A system for integration and visualization of diverse biomedical NLP applications.


About
===

NLP-TAB is a web-based system designed to allow researchers and developers of Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems
to compare the output of several disparate NLP systems to each other or to a manually created reference standard.
The comparison is performed by running the NLP systems on a single corpus of text with subsequent statistical analysis
of co-occurrences between annotations generated by NLP systems. Analysis results are stored and indexed using the
ElasticSearch technology and displayed to end users with a custom web-based interface.

This repository contains scripts for creating a NLP toolchain VM.


Installing
===

### Prerequisites

	1. Vagrant - vagrant is a tool for distributing development environments using VM 
	boxes. You can download it [here](https://www.vagrantup.com/).
	2. 
	
	
### Installation

Once you have vagrant installed, you can install the NLP-TAB NLP Toolchian VM using the 
following command:

	vagrant init nlpie/nlptab-vm; vagrant up
